1. - organize program to smaller pieces to do particalar tasks
   - ease to reuse and reduce
2. - to define a function, do something like:
	def <function_name> (<arguments>): # maybe no arguments
	    #some statements in here  
3. - to call a function:
	<function_name>(<arguments>) #or no arguments
4. - return is a statement to give the program want when call the functions
(maybe a boolean value, a string, a interger number, ...)  
     use it when we want our function give us something not only excute a block statement
     to use return statement, we write it in the end of the function 
5. - no, we don't
6. - the easest way to do this is copying then pasting a part of the other file where contains the defining of function =))
Just kidding =))
     to do that, we imagine the file contains the function we want use is a module and use import statement to import that module then call the function normally =))
